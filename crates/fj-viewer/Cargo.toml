# We don't depend on `getrandom` directly, but we need this to enable the
# `wasm_js` feature when cross-compiling to WASM. Otherwise, `getrandom` will
# not build.
#
# Please note that this alone is not enough to make this workaround work. To
# make the selected backend available, `--cfg` flag needs to be passed to rustc.
# We do this in `tools/cross-compiler/src/main.rs`.
