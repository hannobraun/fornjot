//! Append-only object storage
//!
//! So, why a custom data structure? Well, for two reasons:
//!
//! 1. No limitations on performance.
//! 2. Best possible convenience.
//!
//! Please note that I'm deliberately saying "no limitations" on performance. So
//! far, performance has not been a priority, so this might not be that fast.
//! But by having a custom data structure, we should be able to make performance
//! as good as we need it, within the limits of the practical.
//!
//! The second point, best possible convenience, is already realized.
//! [`Handle`]s can be owned, cloned, and dereference to the object they are
//! referencing. This is made possible by the append-only nature of our object
//! storage, and our immutable objects.
//!
//! There are other append-only data structures on `crates.io`. Some of them
//! look interesting, but none of them quite fit our needs and possibilities, so
//! a custom development seemed justified.
//!
//! But in any case, this was fun to write, and not that much work.
