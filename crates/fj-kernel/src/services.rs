/// A service that controls access to some state
///
/// `Service` is a generic wrapper around some state, as well as code that knows
/// how to operate on that state. It processes commands, changes the state based
/// on those command, and produces events that capture these changes. These
/// events are stored, providing a log of all changes to the state, and can be
/// replayed later to re-create the state at any point in time.
///
/// The wrapped state must implement [`State`], which defines the type of
/// command that this service processes, and the type of event that captures
/// state changes. It also defines methods that operate on the state, commands,
/// and events.
///
/// Implementations of [`State`] might also define an extension trait for a
/// specific `Service<MyState>`, to provide a convenient API to callers.
///
/// This design takes inspiration from, and uses the nomenclature of, this
/// article:
