        // The result of sweeping a `Vertex` is an `Edge`. Seems
        // straight-forward at first, but there are some subtleties we need to
        // understand:
        //
        // 1. To create an `Edge`, we need the `Curve` that defines it. A
        //    `Curve` is defined in a `Surface`, and we're going to need that to
        //    create the `Curve`. Which is why this `Sweep` implementation is
        //    for `(Vertex, Surface)`, and not just for `Vertex`.
        // 2. Please note that, while the result `Edge` has two vertices, our
        //    input `Vertex` is not one of them! It can't be, unless the `Curve`
        //    of the resulting `Edge` happens to be the same `Curve` that the
        //    input `Vertex` is defined on. That would be an edge case that
        //    probably can't result in anything valid, and we're going to ignore
        //    it for now.
        // 3. This means, we have to compute everything that defines the
        //    resulting `Edge`: The `Curve`, the vertices, and the
        //    `GlobalCurve`.
        //
        // Before we get to that though, let's make sure that whoever called
        // this didn't give us bad input.

        // So, we're supposed to create the `Edge` by sweeping a `Vertex` using
        // `path`. Unless `path` is identical to the path that created the
        // `Surface`, this doesn't make any sense.
        //
        // Further, the `Curve` that was swept to create the `Surface` needs to
        // be the same `Curve` that the input `Vertex` is defined on. If it's
        // not, we have no way of knowing the surface coordinates of the input
        // `Vertex` on the `Surface`, and we're going to need to do that further
        // down.
        //
        // Let's make sure that these requirements are met.

        // operation.
        //
        // They both share a u-coordinate, which is the t-coordinate of our
        // input `Vertex`. Remember, we validated above, that the `Curve` of the
        // `Surface` and the curve of the input `Vertex` are the same, so we can
        // do that.
        //
        // Now remember what we also validated above: That `path`, which we're
        // using to create the output `Edge`, also created the `Surface`, and
