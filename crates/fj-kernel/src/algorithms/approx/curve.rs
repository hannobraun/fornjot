//! Curve approximation
//!
//! Since curves are infinite (even circles have an infinite coordinate space,
//! even though they connect to themselves in global coordinates), a range must
//! be provided to approximate them. The approximation then returns points
//! within that range.
//!
//! The boundaries of the range are not included in the approximation. This is
//! done, to give the caller (who knows the boundary anyway) more options on how
//! to further process the approximation.
